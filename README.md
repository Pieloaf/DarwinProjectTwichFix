## Darwin Project Twitch Fix

The in game browser for Darwin Project is no longer supported by Twitch for secure login. This script works around that by using the systems default browser and passing the authentication credentials to the game client.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You will need to generate and install a `selfsigned.key` and `selfsigned.cert` file and put them in a `./keys` folder in the project directory.
